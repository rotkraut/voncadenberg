        <p>The Von Cadenberg has a long history. Its name is inspired by its renowned owner: Giuseppe Antonio Slop. </p>
        <h2>Who was Slop?</h2>
        <p>He was born in 1740 in the villa that his father Francesco and his wife Lucrezia used as a summer and autumn residence. Yes, you've got it right: it was our blue house!</p>
        <p>In 1760 the family was granted the noble title of "Von Cadenberg" by Maria Theresa of Austria. Later on Giuseppe Slop became an internationally renowned astronomer.

        <p>When he took some time away from Pisa (in Tuscany), where he worked, Slop used to come to Cadine. We can imagine him spending his nights in the observatory at the top of the house gazing at the sky and the heavenly bodies. He made his most important discoveries in the observatory of Pisa. He assiduously studied Saturn and Jupiter and their opposition to better determine their orbits and made important observations on comets.</p>

        <h2>Why is Giuseppe Slop so famous?</h2>

        <p>Slop's sensational discovery, however, is the planet <b>Uranus</b>.</p>
        <p>He was not the first to identify its position, as it was revealed by Sir Frederick William Herschel in 1781, but the famous English astronomer thought it was a "curious nebula star" or a comet. Slop performed several calculations on the orbit of the star and published, together with other astronomers, a sensational discovery: the "Georgian star", named in this way by Herschel, was actually a planet!</p>
        <p>Slop published his calculations and conclusions the following year in "Novi planetae observationes et theoria". He then constantly studied the new planet, exchanging letters with important Italian and European astronomers. Today, many of his studies are still in the library of the University of Pisa, unpublished.</p>

        <h2>This is why the Von Cadenberg is blue...</h2>

        <p>To pay homage to one of the most important and perhaps least known scientists in Trentino, we decided, when we renovated the house, to paint it blue, like the colour of the sky that our astronomer tirelessly observed and that of his favourite planet.</p>
