        <p>Does your heart break too when you have to leave your pet at home?  Even worse if you go on holiday without it.</p>
        <p>With us you won't have to worry about leaving your four-legged friend at home: it can be our guest too!</p>

        <p>We also have two furry companions who follow us during our excursions and wherever we go: Leo and Ginger.</p>

        <p>We know our dogs and their needs in terms of cleanliness, noise and obedience. We are very happy to welcome any pet. The only thing we ask is that all our guests (pets included) keep the spaces of the Von Cadenberg as clean as they found them: just like you would do in the mountains.</p>

        <h2>Why should your take your pet friend with you on holiday?</h2>
        <p>People often think that having a dog on holiday only brings problems: dogs have needs that cannot be ignored, some places are just not made for them and in other places they are not accepted.</p>
        <p>In Trentino there are endless activities that you can do with your faithful companion. You can go on long hikes in the woods and mountains (we are sure that the whole group will appreciate them!), you can spend days at the lake, where you can dive together into the water or relax on a meadow in the shade of a tree. In Trentino you can also go to specialized beaches where your dog can have fun swimming in complete safety and make new friends.</p>

        <h2>What should you pay attention to in the mountains with your dog?</h2>
        <p>You have never been on holiday with your dog and need advice on hiking tours that you can enjoy with it? Leo &amp; Ginger will be happy to show you some places they liked and that they recommend for your hikes. Soon there will be a new section in our blog dedicated specifically to this topic! </p>
        <p>Holidays are mainly about having fun, but you also have to be prepared for all eventualities. To avoid fines or other problems it might be useful to know some simple rules of conduct and some tricks: </p>
        <ul class="a">
          <li>Do not let your dog contaminate these beautiful places. Please remove any "stinking souvenir" and always take a bottle of water to clean up if needed. </li>
          <li>Beware of ticks! These unpleasant pests mainly hide in forests and high grass. Keep yourself and your dog monitored. Ticks can also cause bad diseases. If you find out that you have been stung, you should go to the hospital and let the medical staff check you. </li>
          <li>Remember to always have a bottle of water and a bowl with you, especially in summer and during a hike.  Your pet will be thirsty just like you! </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Do you need a vet?</h3>
        <p>As you know by now, we have two lovely dogs ourselves.</p>
        <p>If you need a vet during your holiday, don't worry! We can recommend you our trusted vet!</p>
        <p>In this way you will know that your faithful companions will be in good hands even if they are far from home.</p>
